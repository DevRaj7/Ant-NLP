# Ant-NLP
> Annotation-NLP (Ant NLP) is a text annotation tool that can be used to annotate math word problems using a graph based approach.

## What is Ant-NLP? ðŸ¤”
Annotation of text is crucial for NLP research, and while most tools involve highlighting text/labelling, sometimes a more niche approach is required. Ant-NLP helps annotate text, or more specifically - simple math word problems, by creating a graph data structure based visualization of the various states invovled in solving the problem. 

Sample word problem -
```
There are 4.0 walnut trees currently in the park. 
Park workers will plant 6.0 walnut trees today. 
How many walnut trees will the park have when the workers are finished?

The graph that models this problem

</p>

Here, the nodes represent the various states in the problem, while the edges represent some sort of action/evaluation on those states.  

The state parameter `unit` keeps track of specific units, while `attribute` keeps track of details regarding the entity. For example, if a problem contains the entity `ball`, then it's attribute could be `yellow` or `red`. This problem does not need these 2 parameters.

## Installation of Ant NLP from source ðŸš€

After cloning the repository to your local system, create a virtual environment, and activate it.

```
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv env
```

On Windows, powershell
```
.\env\Scripts\activate.ps1
```

On Mac/Linux
```
source ./env/bin/activate
```

Then install the required packages using the specified requirements.txt file
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To launch the server and run the project,
```
python -m flask run
```
